# Storehouse
> The most basic SQLite file database manager

## Description
A simple SQLite database manager created with Flask and React JS. It is meant for aiding the design and development of any SQLite file database you decide to create for whatever purpose (mobile, web, etc.). Storehouse is soon to contain two different views to manage your database: your basic query window and results table, and a GUI for dragging, dropping, creating, deleting, and updating your tables and relationships (the latter is currently in development).
